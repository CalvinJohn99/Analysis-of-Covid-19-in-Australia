# A Comparative Analysis of Covid-19 in Australia
---

This project involved 3 parts:
- Gathering Covid-19 data
- Visualizing the data to illustrate findings and perform exploratory data analysis
- Writing a report to explain findings

The purpose of the project is to examine the data about Covid-19 to understand how Covid-19 has spread and comparing Australia's efforts 
in controlling and minimizing the spread of the virus with other countries. To achieve this, data visualization techniques were  used to find
interesting trends in the data and highlight patterns.

The reason we are interested in Australia is because during the run of the Covid-19 pandemic, Australia enforced several rules that became the 
subject of much controversy and resulted in drastic differences in how Covid-19 was handled when compared to other countries. The spread of new
Covid-19 variants in Australia was also of concern.

The data collection and visualization process is detailed in the report. You can overview the various visualizations below:
